# MasterMind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players.  
 
The computer becomes the codemaker, the player becomes the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of five code pegs. 
 
The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within eight to twelve turns. Once the guess has been made, the codemaker provides feedback. The feedback is given by a black and white peg. A black key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the correct position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position. 
 
For example, if the hidden code is red-red-blue-blue and the player guesses red-red-red-blue, the codemaker will award two blacked colored key pegs for the two correct reds, nothing for the third red as there is not a third red in the code, and a black colored key peg for the blue. No indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second blue. 
 
Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or the maximum number of tries is reached.
